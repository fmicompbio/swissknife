\title{Aggregate different rows assigned to the same ID by calculating a 
weighted mean}
\usage{
weightedMeanByID(
  SE,
  assay,
  idCol = "GENEID",
  groupCol = "group",
  log2Transformed = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SE}{a \code{SummarizedExperiment} object that contains an assay with
values to be aggregated, a colData column that assigns samples to their
group and a rowData column with IDs to indicate which rows to combine.}

\item{assay}{the name of the assay in the SummarizedExperiment object that 
should be aggregated.}

\item{idCol}{the column name in the rowData of the SummarizedExperiment 
indicating the feature ID.}

\item{groupCol}{the column name in the colData of the SummarizedExperiment 
indicating which columns belong to the same group and should be averaged as
replicates, before the weighted mean is calculated across rows.}

\item{log2Transformed}{a \code{logical} indicating whether values in the 
assay are log2 transformed. If log2Transformed is TRUE, an exponential
transformation will be applied before aggregating the values and another
log transformation afterwards.}
}
\value{
The output is a \code{data.frame} with one column for each of the 
unique names in the groupCol and one row for each of the unique IDs in the
idCol. The row and column names are the respective unique values. The entries
represent the weighted means for each unique feature ID. If all the input 
values were NA, the aggregated value is also NA, while for all zero, the 
output remains zero. If log2Transformed is true the output will be log2
transformed again.
}
\description{
First row means are calculated to summarize across replicates 
identified by the groupCol in the colData. Then different row means that are 
assigned to the same feature ID given by the idCol in the rowData are 
summarized by calculating a weighted mean. This weighted mean is the sum of 
the squared row means divided by the sum of the row means. If all row means 
are 0, they remain 0 in the output.
